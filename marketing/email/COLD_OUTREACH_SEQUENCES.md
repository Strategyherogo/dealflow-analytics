## Sequence 1: The Time-Saver Approach
**Target**: Partners at funds with 3-10 investors
**Goal**: Demo booking

### Email 1 - Day 1: The Compelling Question
```
Subject Lines (A/B Test):
A: Question about [Firm Name]'s deal flow process
B: How does [Firm Name] analyze 100+ deals/month?
C: [Partner at Competitor Firm] suggested I reach out

Hi [First Name],

I've been studying how top-tier VCs handle deal flow, and I'm curious:

How does [Firm Name] currently analyze the ~100+ deals that come across your desk each month?

I ask because I noticed you invested in [Portfolio Company 1] and [Portfolio Company 2] recently - both in completely different sectors. The research burden must be intense.

Most Partners tell me they're spending 40+ hours/week just on initial screening.

We built something that cuts this to 10 hours. [Competitor Firm] is using it to analyze 3x more deals with the same team.

Worth a quick chat to see if this could help [Firm Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]

P.S. - It's a Chrome extension, so no IT integration needed. Takes 30 seconds to install.
```

### Email 2 - Day 4: The Case Study
```
Subject: How [Similar Firm] evaluates 300% more deals

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my previous note about deal flow analysis.

Thought you might find this interesting:

[Similar Firm Name] was drowning in deal flow (sound familiar?). They were seeing 1,200 deals/year but could only properly evaluate 200.

After installing our Chrome extension, they now:
- Review 100+ deals per week (up from 30)
- Spend 15 minutes per initial analysis (down from 90)
- Catch opportunities they previously missed

The secret? 7 AI models analyzing simultaneously while they browse normally.

Here's their case study: [Link]

Would this be valuable for [Firm Name]'s investment team?

[Your Name]

P.S. - I can show you exactly how they use it in a 15-min screen share. Calendar link here: [Calendly]
```

### Email 3 - Day 8: The Peer Pressure
```
Subject: Quick update on what VCs are using

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this brief.

These firms started using DealFlow Analytics in the last 30 days:
- [Competitor 1]
- [Competitor 2]
- [Peer Firm]
- [Respected Firm]

They're all reporting 50-70% time savings on initial deal analysis.

The common feedback: "Why didn't this exist sooner?"

Still happy to show you what they're seeing. Takes 15 minutes.

[Your Name]

P.S. - We're raising our prices next month, but I can lock in current pricing for [Firm Name] if we connect this week.
```

### Email 4 - Day 12: The Break-up
```
Subject: Should I stop reaching out?

Hi [First Name],

I've sent a few notes about how we're helping VCs analyze deals faster.

Haven't heard back, which tells me one of three things:

1. You're happy with your current process (great!)
2. This isn't a priority right now (understood)
3. My emails are getting lost (happens)

If it's #3, here's the TL;DR:
- Chrome extension with 7 AI models
- Analyze any startup in seconds
- 500+ VCs already using it
- 10 free analyses to test

If it's #1 or #2, no worries. I'll stop reaching out.

Either way, best of luck with [Recent Investment]'s Series B!

[Your Name]
```

### Email 5 - Day 20: The Re-engagement
```
Subject: New feature alert (you asked for this)

Hi [First Name],

Remember when VCs asked for predictive exit valuations?

We just launched it.

Our AI now predicts exit multiples with 73% accuracy based on 100K+ historical investments.

[Big Name Firm] used it last week and found a overlooked SaaS company that our model says is undervalued by 3x.

Want to see it in action? Here's a 2-minute demo: [Loom Link]

[Your Name]

P.S. - Still offering 10 free analyses if you want to test it on your pipeline.

## Sequence 2: The Competitor Angle
**Target**: Funds using PitchBook/CB Insights
**Goal**: Free trial activation

### Email 1 - Day 1: The Cost Question
```
Subject: Is [Firm Name] happy paying $40K/year for PitchBook?

Hi [First Name],

I saw [Firm Name] uses PitchBook for deal analysis.

Quick question: Are you actually using more than 10% of its features?

I ask because every VC I talk to says the same thing:
- "It's too expensive"
- "The interface is clunky"
- "We only use it for basic lookups"

We built DealFlow Analytics as the antidote:
- 95% cheaper ($149/mo vs $3,500/mo)
- Works in your browser (no separate login)
- AI-powered insights (not just data)

Worth a quick comparison? Happy to show you the differences.

[Your Name]

P.S. - You can run both in parallel. We actually complement PitchBook well.
```

## Sequence 3: The Problem-Solution Fit
**Target**: Seed and Series A funds
**Goal**: Product adoption

### Email 1 - Day 1: The Pain Point
```
Subject: Still copying and pasting into ChatGPT?

Hi [First Name],

I noticed your team is active in the AI/ML investment space.

Are you still copying and pasting startup descriptions into ChatGPT for analysis?

(Don't worry, everyone was doing this 6 months ago)

There's now a better way:
- Our Chrome extension adds 7 AI models to every webpage
- No copying, pasting, or context switching
- Your whole team sees the same analysis

Quick demo? [Calendar link]

**Goal**: Enterprise deals

### Email 1 - Day 1: Strategic Focus
```
Subject: [Firm Name]'s competitive advantage in AI-powered deal flow
