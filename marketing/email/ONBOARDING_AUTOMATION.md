### Email 5: Success Story (Day 7)
```
Subject: How Bessemer found a unicorn everyone missed

Hi [First Name],

Story time (with a $2B ending):

Bessemer was reviewing 120 deals one week. Overwhelming, right?

Using DealFlow, their analyst noticed something odd:
- GPT-4 loved a company's tech
- Claude questioned the market size  
- But Gemini predicted 100x growth

The disagreement made them dig deeper.

That company? Now valued at $2B.

The lesson: AI disagreement = human investigation.
