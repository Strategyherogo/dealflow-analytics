‚Ä¢ 74% accuracy on exit valuations
‚Ä¢ Real-time competitive analysis
‚Ä¢ Team assessment & market sizing
‚Ä¢ Technical due diligence automation

‚Ä¢ Found 3 unicorns in "rejected" folders
‚Ä¢ ‚Ç¨1.2M ROI proven (from founder's previous ML work)

üèÜ WHY WE'RE DIFFERENT
We're not another SaaS company building for VCs. We ARE VCs. This tool runs our deal flow at The Alternative, processing 5,000+ startups monthly.

üéÅ PRODUCT HUNT EXCLUSIVE
