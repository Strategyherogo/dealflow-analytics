1/ üöÄ We just launched DealFlow Analytics on @ProductHunt!

The Chrome extension that's replacing $40K/year enterprise tools for VCs.

Here's why 50+ funds are already using it üßµ

2/ The problem: VCs spend 40+ hours/week reading about startups across 20+ websites.

Current solutions cost $30-50K/year and require training.

We built something different.

3/ One extension. 7 AI models. Zero learning curve.

Just browse normally - TechCrunch, LinkedIn, company websites.

Click our button for instant AI analysis from GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and more.

4/ But here's the killer feature:

Your whole team sees the same insights in real-time.

No more "did you see that article?" Slack messages.

Everyone's literally on the same page.

5/ We trained our models on 100K+ successful investments.

Now they can predict exit valuations, identify red flags, and spot patterns humans miss.

Accuracy? 73% on historical data.

6/ Pricing? 

Free: 10 analyses
Pro: $149/mo (unlimited)
Enterprise: $499/mo (team features)

That's 95% cheaper than PitchBook.

7/ Your upvote helps us reach more VCs who need this: [Link]

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DealFlow Analytics Launches Chrome Extension to Democratize AI-Powered Investment Analysis

Extension brings institutional-grade AI tools to 15,000+ VC firms at 95% lower cost

SAN FRANCISCO, CA - [Date] - DealFlow Analytics today announced the public launch of its Chrome extension that integrates seven leading AI models directly into any webpage, enabling venture capitalists to conduct comprehensive due diligence in seconds rather than hours.

The extension addresses a critical pain point in venture capital: the average VC spends 40+ hours weekly researching startups across dozens of websites. DealFlow Analytics eliminates this friction by providing instant AI analysis wherever investors already work - from TechCrunch articles to LinkedIn profiles to company websites.

"We're democratizing access to AI-powered investment tools," said Evgeny Goncharov, founder of DealFlow Analytics. "Why should only large funds with $50K+ budgets have access to advanced analytics? Every investor deserves institutional-grade tools."

Key features include:
‚Ä¢ Multi-model AI analysis (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Groq, and more)
‚Ä¢ Real-time team collaboration
‚Ä¢ Predictive exit valuations using machine learning
‚Ä¢ Natural language queries for custom analysis
‚Ä¢ One-click report generation

Early adopters report 70% time savings on initial deal screening and 3x more deals analyzed per week. The extension is free for 10 analyses, with Pro plans starting at $149/month - 95% less than traditional solutions.

DealFlow Analytics is now available on the Chrome Web Store and Product Hunt.

About DealFlow Analytics:
DealFlow Analytics builds AI-powered tools for the venture capital industry. The company's mission is to help investors make better decisions faster through accessible, intelligent technology.
