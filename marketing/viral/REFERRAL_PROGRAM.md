## Implementation Architecture

### Technical Stack
```javascript
// Referral tracking system
const referralSystem = {
  // Generate unique referral codes
  generateCode: (userId) => {
    return `${userId.substring(0,4)}-${Date.now().toString(36)}`;
  },
  
  // Track referral source
  trackReferral: (code, newUserId) => {
    database.referrals.create({
      referrer_id: parseCodeToUserId(code),
      referred_id: newUserId,
      status: 'pending',
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  },
  
  // Validate successful conversion
  validateConversion: (referredId) => {
    if (user.subscription === 'paid' && user.daysActive >= 30) {
      updateReferralStatus(referredId, 'successful');
      creditReferrer(referrerId, getTierReward(referrerTier));
      sendSuccessNotification(referrerId, referredId);
    }
  },
  
  // Leaderboard logic
  getLeaderboard: () => {
    return database.query(`
      SELECT 
        user_name,
        company,
        COUNT(*) as referrals,
        SUM(referred_user_value) as total_value
      FROM referrals
      WHERE status = 'successful'
      GROUP BY referrer_id
      ORDER BY referrals DESC
      LIMIT 10
    `);
  }
};
```

## Viral Mechanics Optimization

### Network Effects Design
```
Every referral creates multiple touchpoints:
1. Referrer shares with colleague
2. Colleague signs up, invites team
3. Team members see "[Referrer] referred [Colleague]"
4. Social proof drives more referrals
5. Leaderboard creates competition
6. Success stories spread organically
```

### Viral Coefficient Calculation
```
Variables:
- i (invitations): 5 average invites sent per user
- c (conversion): 18% accept rate
- Viral Coefficient (K): 5 × 0.18 = 0.9

Result: Near-viral growth (K>1 = true viral)
```

### Time to Referral Optimization
```
Goal: Reduce referral time from 30 days to 7 days

Tactics:
- Day 1: Onboarding includes referral education
- Day 3: First "success moment" triggers ask
- Day 7: Milestone email with referral CTA
- Day 14: Status/leaderboard notification
- Day 30: Tier upgrade opportunity
```
