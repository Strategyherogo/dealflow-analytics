### 1. Yin Hui (Huawei Iberia - CEO)

```
Subject: AI Tool We Built at The Alternative - Enterprise Opportunity

Hi Yin,

Hope you're well! As you know from our previous conversations, I've moved from pure tech to VC as CTO at The Alternative.

We've built something interesting - DealFlow Analytics, an AI-powered Chrome extension that analyzes startups instantly. While designed for VCs, I see huge potential for corporate venture arms like Huawei's.

Key metrics:
- 74% accuracy on exit predictions
- 7 AI models running in parallel
- Already processing 5,000+ companies monthly

Would love to explore an enterprise deployment for Huawei's investment team. Could potentially white-label or customize for your specific criteria.

Worth a quick call next week?

Best,
Evgeny

### 2. Jorge Masalles (Commerzbank - CEO)

```
Subject: FinTech Investment Intelligence Tool from The Alternative

Hi Jorge,

Following up on our last discussion about the Spanish fintech ecosystem.

At The Alternative, we've built DealFlow Analytics to solve our own problem - analyzing hundreds of fintech startups efficiently. Now we're opening it up.

For Commerzbank's venture arm, this could be game-changing:
- Instant analysis of any fintech startup
- Regulatory risk assessment built-in
- European market context (we're GDPR native)

Currently offering enterprise licenses at â‚¬499/month, but happy to discuss a strategic partnership given Commerzbank's position in the market.

Can we schedule 30 minutes next week?

Regards,
Evgeny

Subject: CleanTech Investment Analysis Tool - From The Alternative

Hi Guillermo,

Congrats on the recent Solar360 milestones!

Quick note - at The Alternative, we've built an AI tool that's transforming how we analyze cleantech investments. Given Repsol's venture activities, thought this might interest you.

DealFlow Analytics:
- Analyzes ESG metrics automatically
- Predicts exit valuations with 74% accuracy
- Tracks 500+ cleantech startups weekly

We're offering enterprise access to strategic partners. Would love to show you how it could accelerate Repsol's investment decisions.

Coffee next week in Madrid?

Best,
Evgeny

You'll appreciate this - we've essentially automated the first 80% of due diligence at The Alternative.

DealFlow Analytics uses 7 AI models to analyze startups while you browse LinkedIn/Crunchbase. The results have been incredible:

- 74% accuracy on exit predictions

For cyber/AI investments like yours, it's particularly strong at technical assessment.
