# DealFlow Analytics Privacy Policy URLs

Your privacy policy is available at multiple locations:

## Primary URLs (will be live soon):

1. **GitHub Pages** (recommended):
   - https://strategyherogo.github.io/dealflow-analytics/
   - https://strategyherogo.github.io/dealflow-analytics/privacy.html
   - Status: Deploying (takes 5-10 minutes)

2. **DigitalOcean API**:
   - https://monkfish-app-7otbm.ondigitalocean.app/privacy-policy
   - Status: Deployment in progress

## Alternative Hosting Options:

If you need the privacy policy live immediately, you can use these free services:

### Option 1: GitHub Raw File (Immediate)
Use this URL temporarily while GitHub Pages deploys:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strategyherogo/dealflow-analytics/main/docs/privacy.html
```

### Option 2: Netlify Drop (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the `docs` folder to upload
3. Get instant URL

### Option 3: Surge.sh (2 minutes)
```bash
# Install surge
npm install -g surge

# Deploy
cd docs
surge
# Choose a domain like: dealflow-privacy.surge.sh
```

### Option 4: Vercel (3 minutes)
```bash
# Install vercel
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
cd docs
vercel --prod
```

## For Chrome Web Store Submission:

While waiting for the primary URLs to go live, you can:

1. Use the GitHub raw file URL temporarily
2. Update to the GitHub Pages URL once it's live (usually within 10 minutes)
3. The Chrome review team understands that privacy policies may be hosted on GitHub

## Local File Path:
- `/Users/jenyago/Desktop/Apps Factory/dealflow-analytics/privacy-policy.html`
- `/Users/jenyago/Desktop/Apps Factory/dealflow-analytics/docs/privacy.html`

The privacy policy is also included in the extension package for offline viewing.
